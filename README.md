# MSBA_Capstone
This repo contains all files under my ownership relating to the MSBA Capstone Project.

The portfolio of files showcases my skills and contribution to the MSBA Capstone Project for Swire Coca-Cola. 

The project workbook contains the business problem statement, questions, approach, EDA, comments, results, and conclusion, along with supporting code.
I also have provided the sections of PowerPoint slides that I either created or have contributed to the majority of the strategy the slide is representing.

Overall, the base slide design, theme, and coloration was also of my design. 
The inception of the following strategies was under my ownership:

1) Improved methods of modeling customer success via clustering
2) Discount Risk Mitigation 
3) The following Feature Engineering: 

                   -Clustering potential B2B Partners to build location-based prediction models
                   
                   -Strategy around utilizing census data to predict customer success and ensure proper clustering of current and future B2B Partners
                   
                   -Yelp strategy for predicting current and future B2B partner success, specifically, by restaurant type, stars, and number of reviews
                   
                   -Google Analytics Strategy for predicting how busy and therefore profitable current B2B partners are predicted to be
                          
4) The overall strategy of classifying customers into clusters for the use of building more accurate models (Alvaro, another college, created the clustering model). It is my theory that by utilizing feature engineering and clustering, Swire should be able to build their own regression/classification models to predict profit, transactions, overall risk, and customer lifetime value more accurately. 

Due to the disparate geographical nature between Swire’s B2B Partners, as well as the strong contributing factor location has on a business’s success, building any model based off of the entire dataset is futile.  

The main argument of my theory is that a cluster (or specific location) containing current B2B Partners will be able to better contribute to the accurate prediction of a potential B2B Partner that Swire is vetting out. If ABC Business is being evaluated by Swire, we can draw on the current knowledge of the cluster to understand if the potential B2B partner, let's say a restaurant, is a good fit for the area. We would compare census data of the area or cluster in question against Coke's target customers or demographics for that area. Next, utilizing Yelp data to understand how well similar current B2B Partners are performing, such as similar restaurants, along with the performance of all restaurants in the area to evaluate general performance. The final piece is evaluating the current B2B Partners’ wait times from Google Analytics. A variety of metrics can be used from Google to understand, overall, how busy and therefore successful a current B2B Partner is. The hypothesis is that the longer the wait times, the busier the Partner is and the more revenue the Partner is generating. 

Overall, the more successful a Current and Potential B2B Partner is predicted to be the more likely Coca-Cola’s sales will be higher. Sales are directly related to customer traffic and perception of the Current and Potential B2B Partner. Therefore, we can sufficiently conclude that predicting the overall success of the B2B Partners will help us to better predict profit, transactions, overall risk, and even customer lifetime value for Swire Coca-Cola.
