# MSBA_Capstone
This repo contains all files under my ownership relating to the MSBA Capstone Project
The portfolio fo files showcases my skills and contribution to the MSBA Capstone Project for Swire Coca-Cola. 

The project workbook contains the business problem statement, questions, approach, EDA, comments, results and conclusion, along with suporting code.
I also have provided the sections of PowerPoint slides that I either created or contibuted to the majority of the strategy the slide is representing.

Overall the base slide design, theme, and coloration was of my design. 
The inception of the following strategies were under my ownership:

1) Improved emthods of modeling customer success
2) Discount Risk Mitigation 
3) Feature engineering: 
                          Clustering potential B2B Partners 
                          Strategy around utilizing census data to predict success and ensure  proper clustering of current and future B2B Partners
                          Yelp strategy for predicting current and future B2B partner success, specifically, by restaurant type
                          Google Analytics Strategy for predicting how busy and therefore profitable current B2B partners are
                          
4) The overall strategy of classififying customers into clusters for the use of building more accurate models (Alvaro, another collegue, created the clustering model). It is my thoery that utilizing feature engineering and clustering Swire should be able to build thier own regression/classification model that can accurately predict profit, transactions, overall risk, and even customer lifetime value. Due to the disperate geograhical nature, as well as the strong contributing factor location has on a businesses success, builing any model based off of the entire dataset is futile. 

The main argument of my theory is that a cluster of current B2B partners will be able to better contribute to the prediction of a potential B2B Parter that Swire is vetting out. If ABC Business is being evaluated by Swire, we can draw on current knowlege of the cluster to understand if the potential B2B partner, let's say a restaurant, is a good fit for the area. We would compare census data of the area and the potential B2B Parners specific area to Coke's target customers. Next utilizing Yelp data to udnerstand how well similare current B2B Partners are performing, such as similar restaurants, as well as all restaurants in the area to evaluate general performance. The final piece is evaluating the current B2B Partners wait time from Google Analytics. A variaety of metrics can be used from Google to understand, overall, how busy and therefore successful a current B2B Partner is. The hypothesis is that the longer the wait time, the busier and more revenue the Partner is generating. 

Overall, the more successful a Current and Potential B2B Partner is predicted to be the more likely Coca-Cola sales will be higher. Sales are directely related to customer traffic and perception of the Current and Potential B2B Partner. Therefore we can sufficiently conclude that predicting the overall success of the B2B Partners will help use to better predict profit, transactions, overall risk, and even customer lifetime value for Swire Coca-Cola.
